# Stock-Market-Forecasting-using-AutoARIMA-2025-2026-
This project applies advanced time-series forecasting techniques to predict stock indicesâ€”NIFTY 50 and S&P 500â€”using Python and the AutoARIMA model. The forecasts span from 2015 to early 2025 with the goal of extending predictions for the next 5â€“6 months. This notebook is designed for financial research, market insight generation, and academic exploration.

Project Objectives
ðŸ“Œ Forecast future values of NIFTY 50 and S&P 500 indices using AutoARIMA.

ðŸ“Œ Evaluate stationarity and seasonal behavior in historical data.

ðŸ“Œ Visualize time series trends, residuals, and model fit.

ðŸ“Œ Deploy a reproducible workflow for financial time series forecasting.

Data Collection & Preprocessing- 
- Data Source: Yahoo Finance

- Ticker Symbols:

NIFTY 50: ^NSEI

S&P 500: ^GSPC

- Time Frame: March 2015 â€“ March 2025


Preprocessing Steps:

1. Download historical data using yfinance.

2. Select relevant columns (Date, Close, etc.).

3. Handle missing values and log-transform closing prices for stationarity.

4. Perform seasonal decomposition and stationarity testing.

 Model: AutoARIMA
 
- Utilizes pmdarimaâ€™s auto_arima() to automate model selection.

- Log-transformed data improves stability and removes exponential growth trends.

- Key Evaluation Metrics:

AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)

RMSE on test set

Residual diagnostics


Forecast Output
Models trained separately for:

- df_nifty_log â†’ NIFTY 50 forecast

- df_sp500_log â†’ S&P 500 forecast

Forecast plots include:

1. Actual vs Forecasted values

2. Confidence Intervals

3. Residual distribution

Dependencies
1. pandas

2. numpy

3. matplotlib

4. seaborn

5. statsmodels

6. pmdarima

7. yfinance

8. scikit-learn

 Visuals Included
- Time Series Line Plots

- Seasonal Decomposition

- ADF & Rolling Statistics

Forecast vs Actual Line Graphs

Requirements - 
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
statsmodels
pmdarima
yfinance
scikit-learn

Result - 
- Both indices show clear long-term trends with short-term fluctuations.

- Log transformation + differencing helped achieve stationarity.

- AutoARIMA is robust for univariate financial forecasting when exogenous variables are not included.
